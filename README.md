### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

#### I'm a FrontEnd developer always learning new stuff, my projects are usually private (too personal projects ðŸ˜„) but some of those will be public so it's a reference for myself in the future and a way to get rid of the rust on a previously used language.

### Currently working for clients but creating a home server with âœ¨NextJS, Strapi, Storybook and âš¡more!, stay tuned!!
